# wine-quality-prediction-bharat-intern-
machine learning
this is the project of the wine qualiity prediction.
it is my task from bharat intern really i learned a lot from converting value to the numerical to replace the dataset's null value with mean and make very good model.
at the first time i feel little difficult about this project but it is going very smooth and at the same time i learned after gettingg difficuties in the project that basic concept of the pandas and metplotlib are must require.
in this project not using seaborn library because the dataset of the project is very simple and row.
so this are my input and at the end i want to say thank you to BHARAT INTERN for believing in me give the opportunity of the intenship .

#HAPPY CODING !
